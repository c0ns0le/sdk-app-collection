# Splunk SDK App Collection for SDK testing

The Splunk SDK App Collection contains several small Splunk applications that are purely used for testing Splunk's Software Development Kits (SDKs).

This repository is **ONLY** useful if you are testing one of Splunk's SDKs. **DO NOT INSTALL** unless you are planning to test a Splunk SDK against Splunk.

This SDK App Collection is used to test the following SDKs:

* [splunk-sdk-python](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python)
* [splunk-sdk-javascript](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python)
* [splunk-sdk-java](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-java)
* [splunk-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-ruby)
* [splunk-sdk-csharp](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-charp)
* [splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-charp-pcl)
* [splunk-sdk-php](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-php)

## Installation:
1. Clone the sdk-app-collection repo
2. Move it to ```$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/``` (where $SPLUNK_HOME is the path to your splunk directory)
3. Restart splunk
